This is a simple little web app that is meant to be in a container and accessed locally to deliver a little Chuck Norris style roundhouse of happiness to your day!

It could just as easily be adapted to call the joke api in a webpage. I'm trying to make it into a docker container because I'm also trying to learn docker!

Speaking of which, any tips, tricks, or advice is greatly appreciated!
